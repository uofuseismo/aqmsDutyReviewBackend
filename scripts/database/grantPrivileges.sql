--- Purpose: Grants privileges.  Run after all objects exist.
---
--- Philosophy:
---   * The auth tables (users, user_keys) are reachable ONLY through
---     the auth functions.  Backend roles get EXECUTE, never direct
---     table access, so even the read_write backend cannot SELECT
---     password hashes.
---   * Those functions are therefore SECURITY DEFINER (they run with
---     the owner's privileges, not the caller's), with search_path
---     pinned, which is the standard hardening for definer functions.
---   * 'events' is different: it holds nothing the backend roles are
---     not allowed to see, so it gets ordinary table grants and the
---     backend writes ordinary SQL against it.
---   * PostgreSQL grants EXECUTE on new functions to PUBLIC by default.
---     Revoke wholesale, then re-grant deliberately.
---
--- Everything below is in 'public', so the auth functions and the event
--- objects are neighbours.  The separation between them is now carried
--- entirely by which grants are issued, not by schema membership --
--- which is why the SECURITY DEFINER list below is written out by name
--- rather than swept up with a catalog query.

--- Let the backend roles in the front door.
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE :"db_name" TO :"rw_role", :"ro_role";

--- USAGE lets a role reference objects in the schema; it does not by
--- itself allow reading any table.
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO :"rw_role", :"ro_role";

--- Kill the EXECUTE-to-PUBLIC default on everything before re-granting.
REVOKE ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;

--- Named one at a time on purpose.  The schema-wide loop this replaces
--- would now also catch the event functions and silently run them as
--- the owner.  A function added later is NOT covered until it is added
--- here -- which is the point: it should be a decision, not a default.
---
--- The owner is whoever ran the installer (a superuser), so these
--- functions execute with that authority.  Their bodies touch only the
--- auth tables and take no dynamic SQL, which is what keeps that safe.

--- User management: read_write backend only, and every one of these
--- takes the acting user as its first argument and refuses a caller who
--- is not an administrator.  The grant says which BACKEND may ask; the
--- actor argument says on whose behalf.  Both checks matter -- the
--- reader must not reach these at all, and the writer must not be able
--- to create an account just because it asked nicely.
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION

--- Everything else the writer mutates: a user's own password, their own

--- administrator's business, so none of them take an actor.

--- NOT granted to either backend, deliberately: add_user, remove_user,
--- set_user_permission, add_provisional_user, require_admin,
--- forbid_last_admin_removal.  The first four are the ungated versions
--- the admin_ functions wrap -- reachable only by a superuser, which is
--- how the first administrator gets created:
---
---     sudo -u postgres psql -d aqmsdb_prod \
---       -c "SELECT add_user('bbaker', '\$argon2id\$...', 'admin');"
---
--- The last two are internal; they run as the owner from inside the
--- definer functions and need no EXECUTE of their own.

--- Read/verify functions: both backends.  Note get_password_hash is
--- here because verifying a login IS a read; recording it is not.
--- list_users is safe for the reader because it cannot return a hash.
