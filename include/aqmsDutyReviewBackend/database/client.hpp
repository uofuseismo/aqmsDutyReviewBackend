/// This is where the rubber meets the road: it owns the connection,
/// serializes access to it, re-dials when it drops, and runs queries.  It
/// knows nothing about users, events, or authentication - the stores
/// layered on top own the SQL and the meaning.
///
/// @note Deliberately not called Connection or Session.  It outlives
///       individual connections: when one dies this dials another, which
///       to PostgreSQL is a new session.  That is why the search path has
///       to be re-issued on every reconnect - it is per-session state a
///       new connection does not inherit.
