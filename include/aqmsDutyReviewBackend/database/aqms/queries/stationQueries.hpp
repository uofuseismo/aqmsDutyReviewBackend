/// @brief Reads stations out of the AQMS station_data table.

/// Free functions rather than a class, deliberately.  These are pure
/// functions of (client, parameters) -> model objects with no state to
/// hold, and a stateless class is a namespace with extra ceremony.  It
/// also means there is no "the class" for the next query to accrete onto:
/// a new query is a new function, and nothing else changes.
///
/// They live apart from station.hpp so the model stays ignorant of
/// databases - Station tests in microseconds with no PostgreSQL, and that
/// is worth protecting.

/// @note One station appears once per epoch: the primary key is
///       (net, sta, ondate), so a station that was moved or re-permitted
///       has several rows and all of them come back.  Deduplicating - or
///       picking the epoch covering some instant - is the caller's
///       business, because only the caller knows which instant it means.
/// @note A running station carries some absurdly distant off date rather
///       than a NULL, which is what AQMS writes; a NULL, should one
///       appear, is read as meaning the same thing.  So \c
///       Station::hasStartAndEndTime is always true after a query.
/// @note The particular far-future year is AQMS's business and not fixed.
///       To ask whether a station was running at an instant, test whether
///       the instant falls within its start and end times - never compare
///       the end time against a magic value.
