/// An Earthworm artifact rather than something that happened: a statement
/// that a subnet triggered, with no location and no magnitude behind it.
///
/// @note Deliberately not an EventSummary.  A trigger's row does carry a
///       latitude, longitude, and depth - the columns are NOT NULL in
///       AQMS, so something had to be stored - but they are placeholders
///       and 0, 0 is in the Atlantic.  A type that has to warn people not
///       to trust three of its fields is the wrong type, so those fields
///       are not here to be mistrusted.
///
/// @note There is no review status either, and no event type.  A trigger
///       an analyst decides is real gets an event type assigned and stops
///       being a trigger, so anything still in this list is unreviewed by
///       construction.
