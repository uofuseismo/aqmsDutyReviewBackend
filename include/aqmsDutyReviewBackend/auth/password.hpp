///       password is acceptable; it says what the server is willing to
///       spend to store one.
/// @note These are libsodium's INTERACTIVE parameters: 64 MiB and two
///       passes.  Argon2 is memory-hard on purpose, so memoryLimit is
///       allocated for the DURATION of every hash and every verification.
///       That is per concurrent operation, not per process: a handful of
///       simultaneous logins at libsodium's MODERATE preset is a gigabyte
///       of resident memory arriving at once, which is enough to have a
///       container killed.  Raise these only against a memory limit that
///       can absorb the peak.
/// @note Spelled as literals rather than the crypto_pwhash_* macros so
///       that libsodium stays out of this header and off the library's
///       public interface.  password.cpp static_asserts that they still
///       agree with libsodium, so the two cannot drift silently.

/// @note Returns the reason rather than a bool because the caller cannot
///       reconstruct one: the point of publishing the policy is that a
///       person can fix their password, and "rejected" does not tell them
///       how.
